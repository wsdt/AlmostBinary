# Almost Binary
3 things to know before continuing: 

1. This folder contains a bunch of example files. 
2. Uncompiled files have the **.abin**-file extension and will be compiled to **.wsdt**-files.
3. Compiled library files have the **.abinl**-extension and will be statically compiled into the target-file.
